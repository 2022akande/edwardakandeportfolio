<h1>About Me</h1>

<div class="text" style="text-align: center;">
<p>
  Hello, my name is Edward Akande and I am a full-stack web developer.<br>
  I got my first computer when I was 9, the tower itself was bigger than my chest<br>
  and just about too heavy. Ever since then I was fascinated with computer science.<br>
  Over the years that fascination grew and became hunger, I began learning everything I could<br>
  get in front of me. It is estimated that there is a little under 2 billion active<br>
  websites, this one included. Who's visiting these websites? What kind of websites are they<br>
  visiting? How does one make a website? These are the questions that led me and many<br>
  others down the path of web development.<br>
</p>

  <h1>Time for some question and answer</h1>
  <h3>Q: Do you read any industry websites or blogs?</h3>
  <p>A: Yes of course, just to name a few:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
      <li><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/">blog.codinghorror.com</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://scotch.io/">scotch.io(favorite)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/">smashingmagazine.com</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/">freecodecamp.com/news</a></li>
    </ul>
  <br>
  <h3>Q: Do you prefer to work alone or on a team?</h3>
  <p>A: A team. There are many pros to working on a team the most obvious being a lighter workload.<br>
    In addition to less work, you're also exposed to other peoples code, meaning you might pick up some <br>
    of their good habits. Every developer out there has something to teach me whether they've been coding<br>
    8 years or 8 months.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Q: What web browser do you use?</h3>
  <p>A: All of them. As a web developer, I have to see how my code interacts with any web browser<br>
    a user might find themselves on.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Q: What is your favorite programing language?</h3>
  <p>A: Don't have one. I haven't learned all of them yet so how could I possibly know which one I like<br>
    the most? Don't worry I'll keep you posted. As for the ones I know now python has certainly proved to be<br>
    more versatile than I expected.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Q: Which websites do you find annoying or flawed</h3>
  <P>A: Don't even get me started with Netflix, who told them I wanted to hear a deafening clip of every movie<br>
    I pass over on my way to what I want to watch? In my opinion, any noise that occurs outside of a<br>
    media player is unnecessary.
  </P>
  <br>
  <h3>Q: What if I wanted to ask you a question and you didnt predict it and answer it above?</h3>
  <p>A: Simply visit my contact page where you should be able to reach me in some form or fashion.</p>
